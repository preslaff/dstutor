      # Loops (for and while)

      Automate repetitive tasks! Loops let you execute code multiple times
      without writing it over and over.

      **What you'll learn:**
      - for loops for iterating
      - while loops for conditions
      - break and continue statements
      - range() and enumerate()

    concept: |
      ## Repeating Code with Loops

      **1. for Loop - Iterate Over Sequences**

      Loop through items in a list, string, etc.:
      ```python
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      for fruit in fruits:
          print(fruit)
      ```

      **2. range() Function**

      Generate sequence of numbers:
      ```python
      # range(stop) - 0 to stop-1
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

      # range(start, stop)
      for i in range(2, 6):
          print(i)  # 2, 3, 4, 5

      # range(start, stop, step)
      for i in range(0, 10, 2):
          print(i)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
      ```

      **3. while Loop - Repeat While Condition is True**

      ```python
      count = 0
      while count < 5:
          print(count)
          count += 1  # Don't forget to update!
      ```

      **Warning:** Make sure the condition eventually becomes False,
      or you'll have an infinite loop!

      **4. break Statement**

      Exit the loop immediately:
      ```python
      for i in range(10):
          if i == 5:
              break  # Stop loop when i is 5
          print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
      ```

      **5. continue Statement**

      Skip current iteration, continue with next:
      ```python
      for i in range(5):
          if i == 2:
              continue  # Skip when i is 2
          print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 3, 4 (skips 2)
      ```

      **6. enumerate() Function**

      Get both index and value:
      ```python
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
          print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
      # 0: apple
      # 1: banana
      # 2: cherry
      ```

      **7. Loop Over Dictionary**

      ```python
      scores = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}

      # Loop through keys
      for name in scores:
          print(name)

      # Loop through key-value pairs
      for name, score in scores.items():
          print(f"{name}: {score}")
      ```

      **8. Nested Loops**

      Loop inside a loop:
      ```python
      for i in range(3):
          for j in range(2):
              print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
      ```

      **When to Use Each Loop:**
      - **for loop**: When you know the sequence (list, range, etc.)
      - **while loop**: When you don't know how many iterations needed

  exercise:
    title: "Sum of Numbers"

    instruction: |
      Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

      **Task:** Create a variable `total` that contains the sum of
      all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).

      **Hint:** Use range(1, 11) to get numbers 1 through 10.

    setup_code: |
      # Your code will calculate the sum

    starter_code: |
      # Your code here
      total = 0

    solution: |
      total = 0
      for i in range(1, 11):
          total += i

    validation:
      type: "value_check"
      checks:
        - variable: "total"
          expected: 55
          type: "int"

    hints:
