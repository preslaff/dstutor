# Getting Started with DS-Tutor

**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Status:** Documentation for platform in development
**Note:** Platform testing in progress - instructions below are theoretical and need validation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**DS-Tutor is currently in development.** The curriculum is 100% complete (57 lessons), but the Jupyter extension platform has not yet been tested in a real environment. This guide describes how the platform is *intended* to work, but functionality needs to be validated.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Curriculum:** 100% complete (57 lessons ready)
- üöß **Platform:** Code complete, testing in progress
- üéØ **Beta:** Target Q2 2025

---

## Quick Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic familiarity with Jupyter notebooks

### Step 1: Clone and Install

**Note:** DS-Tutor is not yet published to PyPI. Install from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ds-tutor.git
cd ds-tutor

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

This will install DS-Tutor and all required dependencies.

### Step 2: Set Up API Key (Optional but Recommended)

DS-Tutor uses Claude AI for intelligent hints and feedback. To enable this feature:

1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. Set the API key as an environment variable:

**Windows:**
```cmd
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

Or create a `.env` file in your working directory:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Note:** DS-Tutor will work without an API key, but you'll get basic hints instead of AI-powered personalized feedback.

## üß™ Testing the Platform (Current Phase)

### 1. Start Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Create a New Notebook

Create a new Python notebook to test the extension.

### 3. Load the Extension (Untested)

In the first cell, try:

```python
%load_ext src
```

**Expected:** Welcome message should appear
**If it fails:** Report the error - this helps us fix it!

### 4. Initialize the Tutor (Untested)

```python
%dstutor init
```

**Expected:** Setup confirmation and progress tracking initialized
**If it fails:** Check error message and report

### 5. Explore Available Topics (Untested)

```python
%dstutor topics
```

**Expected:** List of 5 topics (Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
**If it fails:** Lesson loading system needs debugging

### 6. Start Learning! (Untested)

```python
%dstutor start python
```

**Expected:**
- Lesson content displays
- Examples show with explanations
- Interactive exercise appears
- Navigation widget shows

**If it fails:** Please document what happens!

## üéØ How It Should Work

### Lesson Structure

Each lesson includes:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of what you'll learn
2. **Concepts** - Explanation of key ideas
3. **Examples** - Working code demonstrations (5-7 per lesson)
4. **Exercise** - Hands-on practice
5. **Validation** - Automatic checking of your solution
6. **Hints** - 3 levels of progressive help
7. **Solution** - Complete solution code
8. **Challenges** - Follow-up exercises

### Working Through Exercises

**Intended workflow:**

1. **Read the exercise instructions** carefully
2. **Write your code** in a cell below the exercise
3. **Execute the cell** - validation should happen automatically
4. **Get feedback** - See if your solution is correct

Example:
```python
# Exercise: Create an array with values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
import numpy as np

result = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
```

## üÜò Getting Help (When Platform Works)

### Need a Hint?

```python
%dstutor hint
```

**Should provide:** Gentle nudge in the right direction

### Need More Help?

```python
%dstutor hint 2  # More specific hint
%dstutor hint 3  # Very specific hint
```

Hints get progressively more detailed.

### Want to See the Solution?

```python
%dstutor solution
```

**Note:** Try to solve it yourself first! Learning happens through struggle.

---

## üß≠ Navigating Lessons (Planned)

### Move to Next Lesson

```python
%dstutor next
```

### Go Back

```python
%dstutor previous
```

### Jump to a Specific Lesson

```python
%dstutor goto numpy_05
```

### Reset Current Lesson

```python
%dstutor reset
```

---

## üìä Tracking Progress (Planned)

### View Your Progress Dashboard

```python
%dstutor progress
```

**Should show:**
- Lessons completed
- Exercises solved
- Accuracy percentage
- Current streak
- Topic-by-topic progress

### View Configuration

```python
%dstutor config
```

## üí° Learning Tips

### 1. **Practice Daily**
Even 15-20 minutes per day is better than long infrequent sessions.

### 2. **Don't Skip Exercises**
The exercises are where real learning happens. Try to solve them yourself before looking at hints.

### 3. **Experiment**
Modify example code to see what happens. Break things and figure out why!

### 4. **Use Hints Wisely**
- Try solving first
- Use hint level 1 if stuck
- Only use higher levels if really needed
- Avoid jumping straight to the solution

### 5. **Review Regularly**
Go back to previous lessons occasionally to reinforce concepts.

### 6. **Take Notes**
Add markdown cells with your own notes and insights.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError` when loading extension

**Solution:**
```bash
cd path/to/ds-tutor
pip install -e .
```

Make sure you're in the project directory and have activated your virtual environment.

### API Key Not Working

**Problem:** Getting basic hints instead of AI feedback

**Solution:**
1. Check your API key is set correctly
2. Verify it in the notebook:
```python
import os
print(os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
```
3. Restart the Jupyter kernel after setting the environment variable

### Database Issues

**Problem:** Progress not saving

**Solution:**
The progress database is stored in `~/.dstutor/progress.db`. If it gets corrupted:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Remove the database (will reset ALL progress)
db_path = Path.home() / ".dstutor" / "progress.db"
if db_path.exists():
    os.remove(db_path)
```

Then reinitialize: `%dstutor init`

### Validation Not Working

**Problem:** Code seems correct but validation fails

**Solution:**
1. Check that your result is stored in a variable named `result`
2. Make sure data types match exactly (array vs list, int vs float)
3. Use `%dstutor solution` to compare with expected solution
4. Check for subtle differences (spaces, case, etc.)
